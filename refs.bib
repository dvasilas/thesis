abstract = {Spanner is a globally-distributed data management system that backs hundreds of mission-critical services at Google. Spanner is built on ideas from both the systems and database communities. The first Spanner paper published at OSDI'12 focused on the systems aspects such as scalability, automatic sharding, fault tolerance, consistent replication, external consistency, and wide-area distribution. This paper highlights the database DNA of Spanner. We describe distributed query execution in the presence of resharding, query restarts upon transient failures, range extraction that drives query routing and index seeks, and the improved blockwise-columnar storage format. We touch upon migrating Spanner to the common SQL dialect shared with other systems at Google.},

In this paper, we describe the DocumentDB indexing subsystem. DocumentDB indexing enables automatic indexing of documents without requiring a schema or secondary indices. Uniquely, DocumentDB provides real-time consistent queries in the face of very high rates of document updates. As a multi-tenant service, DocumentDB is designed to operate within extremely frugal resource budgets while providing predictable performance and robust resource isolation to its tenants. This paper describes the DocumentDB capabilities, including document representation, query language, document indexing approach, core index support, and early production experiences.},

author = {Zhou, Jingren and Larson, Paul and Goldstein, Jonathan},
title = {Partially Materialized Views},
year = {2005},
month = {June},
abstract = {We propose a new type of materialized view called a partially materialized view. A partially materialized view only materializes some of the rows, for example, the most frequently accessed rows, which reduces storage space and view maintenance effort. One or more control tables are associated with the view and define which rows are currently materialized. As a result, one can easily change which rows of the view are stored and maintained. We show how to extend view matching and maintenance algorithms to partially materialized views and outline several potential applications of the new view type. Experimental results in Microsoft SQL Server show that compared with fully materialized views, partially materialized views have lower storage requirements, better buffer pool efficiency, better query performance, and significantly lower maintenance costs.},
