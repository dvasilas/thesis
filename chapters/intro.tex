The goal of this chapter is to motivate and define the research problem that
this thesis addresses, and to introduce its contributions.

\section{Problem Statement}

\section{State-of-the-art}

For motivating the work, we will state the relevance and timeliness of two
application needs / market trends / ... : attribute-based data retrieval, and
geo-distribution of data.

Attribute-based data retrieval: \\
Retrieving data based on descriptive attributes attached to them (as opposed to
retrieval based on primary key or content-based retrieval).

Data geo-distribution: \\
At the same time, data is increasingly geo-distributed (and federated).

Problem definition: \\
This thesis studies how attribute-based retrieval can be performed efficiently
on geo-distributed data.
